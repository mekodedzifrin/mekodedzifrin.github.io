Added the update <code>updateFatalError error:string = Update;</code> which is sent whenever TDLib encounters a fatal error.<br>\n * 2. Added the method <code>setJsLogVerbosityLevel new_verbosity_level:string = Ok;</code>, which allows to change the verbosity level of tdweb logging.<br>\n * 3. Added the possibility to use blobs as input files via the constructor <code>inputFileBlob data:<JavaScript blob> = InputFile;</code>.<br>\n * 4. The class <code>filePart</code> contains data as a JavaScript blob instead of a base64-encoded string.<br>\n * 5. The methods <code>getStorageStatistics</code>, <code>getStorageStatisticsFast</code>, <code>optimizeStorage</code>, <code>addProxy</code> and <code>getFileDownloadedPrefixSize</code> are not supported.<br>\n * <br>\n */\n\n\nvar src_TdClient =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction () {\n  /**\n   * @callback TdClient~updateCallback\n   * @param {Object} update The update.\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Create TdClient.\n   * @param {Object} options - Options for TDLib instance creation.\n   * @param {TdClient~updateCallback} options.onUpdate - Callback for all incoming updates.\n   * @param {string} [options.instanceName=tdlib] - Name of the TDLib instance.
